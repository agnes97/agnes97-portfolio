    <p>
      At this start-up, the work moved at the speed of light, and my growth from
      a very green junior to a confident frontend developer was just as swift. I
      was able to enhance both my soft and hard skills, from refactoring old
      code to introducing new technologies to the codebase, such as switching to
      App Router. I worked as a bug validator to catch the most elusive bugs,
      served as a scrum master leading meetings for my team, and much more. I've
      even briefly sticked my head to the (Google) cloud. I had the freedom to
      innovate, balanced by full responsibility for my features, from writing
      the issue to deployment.

      During my time here, I was proud of the playful titles my colleagues gave
      me. Some were official, others inside jokesâ€”I'll let you decipher which is
      which. Things might not be as they seem!

      While searching for a product market fit, ever-changing requirements and
      having an accomplished in-house designer made for a good challenge. How to
      do the best work in the fastes way and how to write code that's as
      future-proof as possible? Despite the rapid pace, I've took time to make
      the developer experience better by refactoring types, writing
      documentation or creating a PR template. We've fondly termed any such
      activity as an "AWF" ("after work feature"). I also organised Cyrkl's
      first internal dev conference "Dev Conf 0".
