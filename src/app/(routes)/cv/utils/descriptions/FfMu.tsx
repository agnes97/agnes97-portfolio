      This internship was focused on reference desk work, including
      bibliographic research in various languages for students of Faculty of
      Arts, Masaryk University Brno. At the reference desk with Aleph,
      integrated library system, I've helped students with any questions and
      navigating in the open acces library which has floor arranged according to
      adjusted Universal Decimal Classification (UDC). Part of the job was also
      work on digitalization of documents that are otherwise lended only on the
      spot.

      I've been learning about teaching information education to university
      students, including correct citation or research strategies. I have a
      certificate for completing the course runned by the library for this
      purpose myself as well.
