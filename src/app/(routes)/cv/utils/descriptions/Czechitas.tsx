      Czechitas empowers women in Czechia to learn programming and enter related
      fields through various courses and workshops. Interestingly, I didn't
      start by taking a course but opted to teach right away. Firstly as a
      coach, I was available during lessons to help participants with exercises,
      typically assisting about five people at a time. The courses range from
      beginner to advanced levels, with some lasting just one evening and
      others, known as academies, running for several months.

      Apart from coaching, I also participated in the mentoring program,
      assisting academy graduates with their final projects. Additionally, I
      served as a lecturer, teaching a course during a summer school organized
      for high school students in partnership with ÄŒVUT.
