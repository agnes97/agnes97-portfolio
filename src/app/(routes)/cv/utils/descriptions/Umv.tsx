      During this internship, I've been focusing mainly on bibliographic
      research with all data almost exclusively written in english. I've chosen
      publications/publications they reviewed for acqusition from nearly 20
      international journals and 30 university publishers. I aimed at 5 research
      centers of the Institute of International Relations. For bibliographic
      references I've used standard ISO 690.

      I've been also cataloging articles using RDA, standard for descriptive
      cataloging, in Caslin, and I've worked with World of Science, Clarivate
      Analytics, citation index and research intelligence platform, to research
      specific journals and their performance represented by their impact
      factor.
